<small>

| Field | Type | Description |

| `color` | `string` | The color that is inputted by the user for countries with values |
| `minValue` | `number` | The smallest value of the input data |
| `maxValue` | `number` | The largest value of the input data |

</small>

## [examples/localization](/examples/localization)

- An example showing how to use the `tooltipTextFunction` to localize tooltip texts.
- The function translates both country names and values to Spanish.
- For example:

| Data | Localized text |
| --- | --- |
| ` { "country": "us", value: 331883986 }` | "Estados Unidos: 3.32 mil mill√≥nes" |

## [examples/onclick](/examples/onclick)

- An example showing how each country can have an `onclick` event handler bound.
- When clicking on a country with value, the React state would be updated.

## [examples/links](/examples/links)

- An example showing how each country can have an `href` bound.
- Each country in the example takes you to its Wikipedia page.

## [examples/text-labels](/examples/text-labels)

- An example showing how to draw custom text labels on the map.
- The callback receives `mapWidth`, the current map width, as the parameter, and responsively draws text labels onto the SVG.
- Besides the `label`, any other keys will be passed as props to the `text` element.
- This example labels the four oceans responsively, coloring the Arctic ocean in another color.

## [examples/rich-interaction](/examples/rich-interaction)

- An example showing how a map with rich interactions enabled is like.
- Try double-clicking on the map!

## [examples/string-value](/examples/string-value)

- Some users do not have a need to display numeric values.
- This is an example showing how each data value can have a string value.
- The same thing can be accomplished with `tooltipTextFunction`, by hiding the number value and adding your string to the Country value (see [localization](/examples/localization)), but this will make that user experience easier.
- If you are using both string and number values together, string will be treated as `minValue`.
